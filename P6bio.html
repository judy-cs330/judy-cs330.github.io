    <h1 class="art-header">About Me</h1>
    <p class="bio">Hi! My name is Judy Ahn. I'm 19 years old and I currently am a freshman at Northwestern University. I
      went to highschool at the National Cathedral School for Girls. I was born and raised in Washington, D.C., but both of my
      parents are Korean immigrants. I have one older brother and a pet hamster named Chewbacca.
    </p>
    <p class="bio">I am majoring in computer science in the Weinberg College for Arts and Sciences, and I have yet to add a minor
      or double major. I have no internship or research experience, but I hope to gain some kind of experience soon. I'd love to
      do something interdisciplinary with computer science, maybe something involving neuroscience or psychology. However, at
      the moment, I am very open to learn all the different fields within computer science. So far, I have taken 6 computer science
      courses at NU, trying to learn as much as I could to be able to practice on my own over the summer and have a vague idea of
      what direction I want to go in. I believe I am a hard-worker who is diligent and easy to work with. Hopefully this summer
      I will be working on personal projects, summer classes, or internship/research opportunities.
